I am Ph.D. student at Universidad Catolica de Chile, in the [IALab](https://ialab.ing.puc.cl/) under the supervision of [Alvaro Soto](https://www.ing.uc.cl/academicos-e-investigadores/alvaro-soto-arriaza/). My research interests are to train models able to learn to use concepts /patterns already learned, encouraging transfer learning between tasks.  For this, the model needs to learn weights generic enough to be useful for new tasks, but specific enough to solve the task. Furthermore, we must devise ways that new tasks can learn to use previously learned concepts. Consequently, my research is focused on Continual Learning, looking for models to be capable of accumulating knowledge with the previously mentioned characteristics.

I am part of the [Continual Learning group](https://www.continualai.org/), actively participating in the reading groups and helping to organize the [2nd Workshop on Continual Learning in Computer Vision](https://sites.google.com/view/clvision2021/). Additionally, I have participated in a few activities of the [Latinx in AI](https://www.latinxinai.org/)
